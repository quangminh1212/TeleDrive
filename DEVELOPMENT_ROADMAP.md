## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database migration complexity**: Create comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- **Performance degradation**: Implement monitoring and optimization from Phase 1
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to phase boundaries
- **Timeline delays**: Buffer time built into each phase
- **Resource constraints**: Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with database integration
2. **Short-term (Month 1)**: Complete Phase 1 core functionality
3. **Medium-term (Month 2-3)**: Implement Phase 2 security features
4. **Long-term (Month 4-6)**: Add collaboration and advanced features

This roadmap provides a structured approach to transforming TeleDrive from a Telegram file scanner into a comprehensive cloud drive solution while maintaining the existing codebase and design patterns.
