## Security Best Practices for Users

### 🔧 Deployment Security
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
2. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables
3. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and restrict access
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and logging

### 🛠️ Configuration Security
```bash
# Example secure configuration
export SECRET_KEY="your-strong-secret-key"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
export ENABLE_ADVANCED_SECURITY="true"
export MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS="5"
export LOGIN_LOCKOUT_DURATION="1800"
```

### 📊 Security Monitoring
- Enable application logging
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security audits
- Check request performance metrics

### 🔐 Advanced Security Configuration
New environment variables for enhanced security:
```bash
# Attack Prevention
export ENABLE_ADVANCED_SECURITY="true"    # Enable advanced security features
export MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS="5"      # Max failed attempts before lockout
export LOGIN_LOCKOUT_DURATION="1800"      # Lockout duration in seconds (30 min)
export ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT="true"           # Enable API rate limiting
export RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT="200 per day"   # Default rate limit
export RATE_LIMIT_HOURLY="50 per hour"    # Hourly rate limit
export MONITOR_MEMORY="true"              # Enable memory monitoring
```
