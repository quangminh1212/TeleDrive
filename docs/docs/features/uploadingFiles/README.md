# Uploading files
TeleDrive adds folders and automatic folder watching to Telegram's saved messages

## Uploading files/folders

Uploading files and folders is as simple as copying/moving them
into TeleDriveSync inside the folder you [selected earlier](../syncedDir)

Since TeleDrive preserves folder hierarchy/structure, your folder structure will be preserved when you [restore](../restoringFiles) your files

## Changing uploaded files/folders

TeleDrive automatically scans and keeps track of your synced files and folders using SHA256 checksums.
Changing any files/folders inside the TeleDriveSync synced folder will update them on Telegram
