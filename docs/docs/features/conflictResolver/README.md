# Resolving conflicts

## What are conflicts?

Conflicts occur when there is a newer version of a file already on saved messages,
but there is an older version of the file saved locally and TeleDrive is trying to back it up.
To prevent loss of newer data already stored on saved messages, a conflict is shown.

- **Fast-Forward local** will keep the version on the cloud (newer) in both places
- **Overwrite Cloud** will keep the local version (older) in both places
